One game to learn them all. Languages, that is. I write this game to learn a new language. Just might finish it this time. (Python)

This process is painfully slow because I am working on it during my personal time. For example, I am typing this sentence during my lunch break. Some evenings I can carve out a few minutes to work on it, but most is done on Saturday afternoons. I can usually escape to the local library for a few hours on a Saturday afternoon. Definitely not the ideal circumstance for learning a new language.
